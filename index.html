<h2>Fun Proofs</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Let <em>A</em> be a group such that every finitely generated subgroup is cyclic. Then, <em>A</em> is a subquotient of the additive group of the rational numbers.</p>
	<div>
	<em>Proof:</em> We first remark that <em>A</em> is abelian since any two elements are contained inside a cyclic subgroup. We break into two cases:
	<ul>
		<li>
		<strong><em>A</em> is torsion-free.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>B</em> be the &#x211A; vector space formed by forming the module of fractions of <em>A</em> with respect to the multiplicative set consisting of all non-zero integers. Using that any two elements of <em>A</em> generate a cyclic subgroup, we find that <em>B</em> is one-dimensional unless <em>A</em> is trivial. Assuming <em>A</em> is non-trivial, then <em>B</em> is isomorphic to the additive group of the rational numbers, so the natural inclusion of <em>A</em> into <em>B</em> embeds <em>A</em> as a subgroup of the additive group of the rational numbers.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong><em>A</em> is not torsion-free.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>S</em> be the set of positive integers <em>n</em> such that there exists a non-zero element <em>x</em> of <em>A</em> such that <em>nx = 0</em>. Since <em>A</em> is not torsion-free, we have that <em>S</em> is non-empty.</p>
		<p>Let <em>na = 0</em> for some non-zero element <em>a</em> in <em>A</em> and some <em>n</em> in <em>S</em>, and let <em>b</em> in <em>A</em>. The subgroup generated by <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is cyclic, so there exists <em>c</em> in <em>A</em> and integers <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> such that <em>a = sc</em> and <em>b = tc</em>. Then, we have that <em>(ns)b = (nst)c = t(na) = 0</em>. Therefore, <em>A</em> is a torsion group.</p>
		<p>For <em>n</em> in <em>S</em>, let <em>A[n]</em> be the set of <em>x</em> in <em>A</em> such that <em>nx = 0</em>. Observe that <em>A[n]</em> is a torsion abelian group of cardinality at most <em>n</em> since if <em>a<sub>0</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub></em> are elements of <em>A[n]</em>, then they generate a cyclic group of exponent <em>n</em> and so there must have been repetitions. In particular, <em>A[n]</em> is a finite cyclic group. Let <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> be the <em>finite</em> set of embeddings from <em>A[n]</em> into the quotient of the rationals by the integers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&#x211A;/&#x2124;</span>.</p>
		<p>If <em>n</em> divides <em>m</em>, then an element of <em>X<sub>m</sub></em> yields an element of <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> by restriction of functions. Hence, the <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> form a projective system. Since the projective limit of non-empty finite sets is non-empty, we find that there is an embedding of <em>A</em> into the quotient of the rationals by the integers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&#x211A;/&#x2124;</span>.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Let <em>A</em> be a commutative ring such that every prime ideal is principal. Then, every ideal of <em>A</em> is principal.</p>
	<div>
	<em>Proof (M. Isaacs):</em> Let <em>S</em> be set of non-principal ideals of <em>A</em>. If <em>S</em> is empty, then every ideal is principal. So, assume <em>S</em> is non-empty.
	<p>Let <em>{I<sub>&alpha;</sub>}</em> be a chain in <em>S</em>. Let <em>I</em> be the union of the ideals <em>I<sub>&alpha;</sub></em>. Then, <em>I</em> is an ideal of <em>A</em>. If <em>I</em> was principal, then its generator would be in one of the <em>I<sub>&alpha;</sub></em>, which would force that <em>I = I<sub>&alpha;</sub></em>. Hence, <em>I</em> is not principal, and so <em>I</em> is in <em>S</em>. By Zorn's lemma, <em>S</em> contains a maximal element <em>M</em>.</p>
	<p>Since <em>M</em> is not principal, it is not a prime ideal by assumption. Thus, there exists elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> not in <em>M</em> such that the product <em>ab</em> is in <em>M</em>.</p>
	<p>Let <em>N</em> be the set of elements <em>x</em> of <em>A</em> such that <em>ax</em> is an element of <em>M</em>. Then, <em>N</em> is an ideal containing <em>M</eM> and containing <em>b</em>. By the maximality of <em>M</em>, we find that <em>N = (n)</em> is principal. Similarly, the ideal <em>K</em> generated by <em>M</em> and <em>a</em> is principal, so <em>K = (k)</em>. We have that <em>KN</em> is contained in <em>M</eM>.</p>
	<p>Let <em>x</em> be an element of <em>M</em>. Then, <em>x</em> is in <em>K</em>, so <em style="white-space: nowrap;">x = kt</em>. Then, <em>t</em> is in <em>N</em> since <em>a</em> is a multiple of <em>k</em>. Therefore, <em style="white-space: nowrap;">t = ns</em>, and <em style="white-space: nowrap;">x = kns</em> is in <em>KN</em>. Thus, <em>M = KN</em>, and <em>M</em> is principal.</p>
	<p>(For similar results and proofs, see Kaplansky's Commutative Rings Revised Edition. The above proof is outlined in Exercise 10 of Section 1-1.)
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Let <em>k</em> be a field, let <em style="white-space: nowrap;">&rho; : G &rarr; GL<sub>n</sub>(k)</em> be a representation of a group <em>G</em>, and let <em style="white-space: nowrap;">r : k[G] &rarr; End(k<sup>n</sup>)</em> be the associated map defined on the group ring. If <em>r</em> is surjective, then <em>&rho;</em> is irreducible. If <em>k</em> is algebraically closed and <em>&rho;</em> is irreducible, then <em>r</em> is surjective.</p>
	<div>
	<em>Proof:</em>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<strong>Suppose <em>r</em> is surjective.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>V</em> be a nontrivial invariant subspace of <em>k<sup>n</sup></em>. Let <em>v</em> be a non-zero element of <em>V</em>. Then, for any <em>w</em> in <em>V</em>, there is an endomorphism of <em>k<sup>n</sup></em> sending <em>v</em> to <em>w</em>. Since <em>r</em> is surjective, there is an element <em>a</em> in <em>k[G]</em> which maps to this endomorphism. Then, since <em>V</em> is an invariant subspace, we have that <em>a.v = w</em> is in <em>V</em>. Hence, <em>V = k<sup>n</sup></em>, and <em>&rho;</em> is irreducible.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>Suppose that <em>k</em> is algebraically closed and that <em>&rho;</em> is irreducible.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>A</em> be the image of <em>r</em>. Then, <em>k<sup>n</sup></em> is an irreducible <em>A</em>-module. Let <em>f</em> be an element of <em>End<sub>A</sub>(k<sup>n</sup>)</em>. By Schur's lemma, there exists <em>&lambda;</em> in <em>k</em> such that <em>f(v) = &lambda;v</em> for all <em>v</em>. Hence, the natural map <em style="white-space: nowrap;">k &rarr; End<sub>A</sub>(k<sup>n</sup>)</em> is an isomorphism. By the Jacobson density theorem, we find that the natural map <em style="white-space: nowrap;">A &rarr; End<sub>k</sub>(k<sup>n</sup>)</em> is surjective as desired.</p> <p>(For a reference for the Jacobson density theorem, see Lang's Algebra, Chapter XVII, Theorem 3.2.)</p>
