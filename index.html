<h2>Fun Proofs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Let <em>A</em> be a group such that every finitely generated subgroup is cyclic. Then, <em>A</em> is a subquotient of the additive group of the rational numbers.
	<p>
	<em>Proof:</em> We first remark that <em>A</em> is abelian since any two elements are contained inside a cyclic subgroup. We break into two cases:
	<ul>
		<li>
		<strong><em>A</em> is torsion-free.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>B</em> be the &#x211A; vector space formed by forming the module of fractions of <em>A</em> with respect to the multiplicative set consisting of all non-zero integers. Using that any two elements of <em>A</em> generate a cyclic subgroup, we find that <em>B</em> is one-dimensional unless <em>A</em> is trivial. Assuming <em>A</em> is non-trivial, then <em>B</em> is isomorphic to the additive group of the rational numbers, so the natural inclusion of <em>A</em> into <em>B</em> embeds <em>A</em> as a subgroup of the additive group of the rational numbers.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong><em>A</em> is not torsion-free.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>S</em> be the set of positive integers <em>n</em> such that there exists a non-zero element <em>x</em> of <em>A</em> such that <em>nx = 0</em>. Since <em>A</em> is not torsion-free, we have that <em>S</em> is non-empty.</p>
		<p>Let <em>na = 0</em> for some non-zero element <em>a</em> in <em>A</em> and some <em>n</em> in <em>S</em>, and let <em>b</em> in <em>A</em>. The subgroup generated by <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is cyclic, so there exists <em>c</em> in <em>A</em> and integers <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> such that <em>a = sc</em> and <em>b = tc</em>. Then, we have that <em>(ns)b = (nst)c = t(na) = 0</em>. Therefore, <em>A</em> is a torsion group.</p>
		<p>For <em>n</em> in <em>S</em>, let <em>A[n]</em> be the set of <em>x</em> in <em>A</em> such that <em>nx = 0</em>. Observe that <em>A[n]</em> is torsion abelian group of cardinality at most <em>n</em> since if <em>a<sub>0</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub></em> are elements of <em>A[n]</em>, then they generate a cyclic group of exponent <em>n</em> and so there must have been repetitions. In particular, <em>A[n]</em> is a finite cyclic group. Let <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> be the <em>finite</em> set of embeddings from <em>A[n]</em> into the quotient of the rationals by the integers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&#x211A;/&#x2124;</span>.</p>
		<p>If <em>n</em> divides <em>m</em>, then an element of <em>X<sub>m</sub></em> yields an element of <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> by restriction of functions. Hence, the <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> form a projective system. Since the projective limit of non-empty finite sets is non-empty, we find that there is an embedding of <em>A</em> into the quotient of the rationals by the integers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&#x211A;/&#x2124;</span>.</p>
